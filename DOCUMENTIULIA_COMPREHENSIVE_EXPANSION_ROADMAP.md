##### 2. **Conversational Tree Navigation**
**Current**: User clicks through decision tree nodes
**Enhanced**: User chats with Claude

**Example**:
```
User: "Vreau să angajez primul salariat"
Claude: "Perfect! Te voi ghida. Este primul angajat al firmei tale?"
User: "Da"
Claude: "Excelent. Câteva informații importante:
- Trebuie să faci declarație 010 la ANAF cu minim 20 zile înainte
- Vei avea nevoie de cont REVISAL
- Control medical obligatoriu pentru angajat

Salariul pe care vrei să-l oferi este minim (3.300 RON) sau mai mare?"
User: "Minim"
Claude: "Costul total pentru tine va fi ~3.600 RON/lună (salariu + contribuții + contabil).

Îți recomand să urmezi pașii din detaliile complete pe care ți le-am pregătit:"
[Shows full answer from decision tree]
"Mai ai întrebări?"
```

##### 3. **Proactive Alerts System**
**Based on User Profile Data** (business type, revenue, employees, etc.):

**Example Scenarios**:
- **Revenue Threshold Alert**:
  - User: SRL on Micro, revenue at 450k EUR (90% of 500k threshold)
  - Alert (Email + In-app): "⚠️ Atenție! Ești aproape de pragul de 500k EUR. Dacă depășești, treci pe impozit profit 16%. Pregătește-te: [Decision Tree Link]"

- **Legislative Change Alert**:
  - System detects update to `minimum_gross_salary_2024` variable (3300 → 3500 RON)
  - Users with employees get alert: "📢 Salariul minim a crescut la 3.500 RON (de la 1 ianuarie 2025). Actualizează contractele! [Checklist Link]"

- **Tax Deadline Reminder**:
  - 7 days before declarația 112
  - Email + push notification: "📅 Declarația 112 este pe 25 noiembrie (în 7 zile). Ai pregătit toate datele? [Checklist]"

- **Course Completion Nudge**:
  - User started "Excel Basics" 30 days ago, completed 40%
  - Email: "📚 Hai să terminăm! Ai rămas la Module 3. Doar 2 ore până la certificat! [Continue Learning]"

- **Mentorship Match**:
  - User applied for mentorship 14 days ago, still unmatched
  - Admin gets alert: "🤝 Mentee application pending for 14 days: [User Profile]. Suggest mentor: [Auto-Matched Mentor]"

#### Implementation:
**Cron Job** (runs daily):
```php
// /api/cron/proactive_alerts.php

// 1. Check all users with SRL on Micro
$users_near_threshold = getUsersNearRevenueThreshold(0.9); // 90% of limit
foreach ($users_near_threshold as $user) {
    sendEmail($user, 'revenue_threshold_warning');
}

// 2. Check for legislation variable updates
$updated_variables = getVariablesUpdatedSince(date('Y-m-d', strtotime('-1 day')));
foreach ($updated_variables as $var) {
    $affected_users = getUsersAffectedByVariable($var['variable_key']);
    foreach ($affected_users as $user) {
        sendEmail($user, 'legislation_update', ['variable' => $var]);
    }
}

// 3. Tax deadline reminders
$upcoming_deadlines = getUpcomingDeadlines(7); // 7 days out
foreach ($upcoming_deadlines as $deadline) {
    $affected_users = getUsersByDeadlineType($deadline['type']);
    foreach ($affected_users as $user) {
        sendEmail($user, 'tax_deadline_reminder', ['deadline' => $deadline]);
    }
}

// 4. Course completion nudges
$stalled_students = getStudentsWithStalledCourses(30, 0.5); // 30 days, <50% complete
foreach ($stalled_students as $student) {
    sendEmail($student, 'course_completion_nudge');
}
```

**Email Templates** (in database):
```sql
CREATE TABLE email_templates (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  template_key VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  subject VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  body_html TEXT NOT NULL,
  variables JSONB, -- List of variables used in template
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

INSERT INTO email_templates (template_key, subject, body_html, variables)
VALUES (
  'revenue_threshold_warning',
  '⚠️ Aproape de pragul de 500k EUR - Pregătește tranziția la Profit',
  '<html>
    <body>
      <h2>Bună {{user_name}},</h2>
      <p>Am observat că cifra ta de afaceri pentru 2025 este de <strong>{{current_revenue}} EUR</strong>, adică {{percentage}}% din pragul maxim de 500.000 EUR pentru regimul micro.</p>

      <p>Dacă depășești acest prag, vei trece AUTOMAT pe impozit pe profit 16% de la trimestrul următor.</p>

      <h3>Ce trebuie să faci acum?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Verifică dacă vei depăși pragul până la sfârșitul anului</li>
        <li>Dacă da, pregătește tranziția: <a href="{{tree_link}}">Ghid complet aici</a></li>
        <li>Angajează contabil specializat în profit (nu orice contabil micro poate)</li>
        <li>Organizează evidența cheltuielilor (devine crucială pe profit!)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Ai întrebări? <a href="{{community_link}}">Întreabă comunitatea</a> sau <a href="{{contact_link}}">rezervă consultație</a>.</p>

      <p>Mult succes,<br>Echipa Documentiulia</p>
    </body>
  </html>',
  '["user_name", "current_revenue", "percentage", "tree_link", "community_link", "contact_link"]'
);
```
